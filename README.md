# TP4: Deploy a NestJS API to CleverCloud

## 📝 Goal

The goal of this TP is to deploy the NestJS API we implemented in previous TPs in The Cloud ☁️.

Using AWS, Azure, GCP? 

No! Using a French 🇫🇷 IT automation company: [CleverCloud](https://www.clever-cloud.com/en/) 
> Clever Cloud provides an IT Automation Platform for developers with bulletproof infrastructure, auto-scaling, fair pricing

 - 



## 🚀 Getting Started

Open a terminal, go to the directory of this TP and run the following commands:

```sh
# This will install all needed dependencies
npm install

# This will run the tests once
npm run test

OR

# This will run the tests everytime a change is made in the source code
npm run test:watch

# This will build the source and put the transpiled code in `/dist` directory
npm run build

# This will start the API 
npm run start:dev
```

That's it! You can code!
